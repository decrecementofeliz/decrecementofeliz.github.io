 Generate doodle scenes from "Quick, Draw!" data

 Live demo: [https://codepen.io/decrecementofeliz/pen/oNNbOxv](https://codepen.io/decrecementofeliz/pen/oNNbOxv)

 This is a fork from [The Coding Train Challenge 122.2](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/122.2-quick-draw) by Daniel Shiffman. It uses the [Quick, Draw! dataset](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/data) provided by Google to generate scenes as sets of drawings (i.e. 'a starry night': moon and stars; 'a mountain view': mountain, airplane, parachute, etc.)

 ## To-dos:
 * Let the user create his own scenes (selecting the words and the x offset, y offset and scale for each one)
